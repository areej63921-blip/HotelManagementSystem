# HotelManagementSystem
This is a Java project for my Software Construction (CCP) course at Iqra University. I built this system step-by-step using 14 UML diagrams.

What this project does?
This system manages hotel bookings. It can:

Add Hotels and Rooms.

Register Customers.

Check if a Room is free.

Make a Reservation.

Check-in Guests and change Room status from 'Free' to 'Occupied'.

Project Development (7 Versions)
I made this project in 7 steps to show how it was built:

V1 (The Start): Created basic classes for Hotel and Rooms.

V2 (IDs): Added unique IDs for customers and bookings.

V3 (Room Status): Added logic so rooms can be Free, Reserved, or Occupied.

V4 (Finding Rooms): Made the system search for empty rooms automatically.

V5 (Linking): Connected the Customer, Room, and Booking together.

V6 (Check-in): Added a way for guests to arrive and stay in the room.

V7 (Cleaning): Fixed all errors and made the code neat.

How to run it?
Copy the files to your computer.

Open your terminal or VS Code.

Type javac *.java to prepare the code.

Type java Main to run the program.
